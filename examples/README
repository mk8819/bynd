To run this script, copy all .data and .dat files contained
in the data/ folder to this directory. Then just run the script.
It should yield a .pdf which compares the result from BYND with the
result of a exact long time dynamics simulation.

In this example our short-time target signal is simply a cut out
of certain length of a long-time dynamics simulation. This enables
a direct comparison between BYND and the exact result. We do not
further prepare the short-time piece. Sometimes, this ad hoc procedure
can results in unwanted spectral behaviour. Ideally,
one would like to have the end of the signal to be zero.
As this code is still in active development, future work is directed towards a tool
which enables a simple preparation of the short-time signal. For
now we advice users to prepare their own signals accordingly.
